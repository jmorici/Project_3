## Avocado's and Machine Learning
Data provided by kaggle.com [Avocado Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices)


## Synopsis

 In this project we decided to display 2 different types of machine learning to predict data from avocados.

 1.) Price forecasting using Facebook's "Prophet" created by Facebook's in house data scientists. Prophet is a procedure for forecasting time series data based on an additive model where non-linear trends are fit with yearly, weekly, and daily seasonality, plus holiday effects. It works best with time series that have strong seasonal effects and several seasons of historical data. Prophet is robust to missing data and shifts in the trend, and typically handles outliers well.

 2.) Convolutional Neural Network or CNNs use a variation of multilayer perceptrons designed to require minimal preprocessing.
  

 We used 3 years of historical price data to forecast avocado prices one year into the future. Next we trained a CNN model using Keras to predict if an image of an Avocado was ripe or not.
